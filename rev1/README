BUILD LINUX VERSION
================================================

I build on Fedora 20. 

In addition to Development Tools, the following packages must be installed:
  SDL2-devel
  SDL2_ttf-devel
  SDL2_mixer-devel
  libpng-devel

To build this program (program name is 'entropy'), just run make.

=======================
BUILD ANDROID VERSION
=======================

Install the Android SDK and NDK. 

The following must be in your PATH:
  android-sdk/tools
  android-sdk/platform-tools
  android-ndk

The ANDROID_HOME environment variable must be set to the android-sdk directory.

Build Steps:
  cd android-project
  ./setup-script
  ./do_build

Note that the setup-script configures 
'APP_ABI := armeabi armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86 x86_64".
