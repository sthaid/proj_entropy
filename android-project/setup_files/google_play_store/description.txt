The purpose of this App is to gain a better understanding of Physics through computer simulations. Includes simulations of:
- Expanding Gas in a Container
- Gravity
- Expanding Universe
- Random Walk

Expanding Gas in a Container simulation - observe:
- increase in entropy when the gas is released
- shrink the container to observe Adiabatic heating
- how entropy can occasionally spontaneously decrease

Gravity simulation - observe:
- orbits of 2 and 3 body systems
- impact a rogue star would have on our solar system
- solar wobble, used by astronomers to detect extrasolar planets
- view planet orbits as seen from the Earth, observe retrograde motion
- how gravity boost works

Expanding Universe simulation - observe:
- rapid expansion during the early universe
- much of the universe lies beyond what can be seen from our vantage point
- as the universe ages the size of the observable universe shrinks

The source code is available at https://github.com/sthaid/proj_entropy.git. This App is coded in C, and utilizes the Simple DirectMedia Layer cross-platform development library. The Random Walk simulation is a good template to use for new simulations. Suggestions for new simulations are: Elastic Collisions, and Bacterial Life.
