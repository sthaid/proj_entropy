LAUNCH CHECKLIST
----------------

Test For Quality
- test on as many devices as possible

Determine Content Rating 
- Everyone,  Low maturity, Medium maturity, High maturity

Determine Country Distribution
- Reasons
  . The need for localized resources in the app.
  . The need for a localized app description in the Developer Console.
  . Legal requirements for the app that may be specific to certain countries.
  . Time zone support, local pricing, and so on

Confirm App's Overall Size
- The maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is 50 MB.
- You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2GB in size, for each APK.

Confirm the App's Platform and Screen Compatibility Ranges
- Check display orienttion   
- Check minSdkVersion
- Test on Tablet and Phone
- Declare the minimum screen-size supported by your apps using <supports-screens>

Decide Whether your App will be Free or Priced
- Free apps must remain free

Start Localization
- Localizing the strings, images, and other resources in your apps.
- Localizing your apps’ store listing details on Google Play.
- Localizing the apps’ graphic assets, screenshots, and videos that accompany your store listing.

Prepare Promotional Graphics, Screenshots, and Videos
- When you publish on Google Play, you can supply a variety of high-quality graphic assets to 
  showcase your app or brand. After you publish, these appear on your store listing page, search 
  results, and elsewhere.

Build and Upload the Release-ready APK
- Preparing for Release
  . release apk is signed with my own certificate and optimized with zipalign tool
- Main Tasks
  . Gather Materials:        EULA, Launch ICON
  . Configure App:           Remove debugging and logging, clean up code
  . Build for Release:       Build release version and sign  (SEE APPENDIX: SIGINING)
  . Prepare Remote Servers:  Web Page
  . Test App:                Test the Signed App

Plan a Beta Release
- Google Developer's Console supports this

Complete the Apps’ Store Listing

- As you get near your target publishing date, you should become familiar with all the fields, 
  options, and assets associated with the store listing configuration page in the Developer Console. 
  As you collect the information and assets for the page, make sure that you can enter or upload 
  it to the Developer Console, until the page is complete and ready for publishing.

- After you've set your apps’ geographic targeting in the Developer Console, remember to add your 
  localized store listing, promotional graphics, and so on, for all of the languages that you support.

- If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure to include at least one screenshot of the app 
  running on a tablet, and highlight your apps’ support for tablets in the app description, 
  release notes, promotional campaigns, and elsewhere.

Final Checks and Publishing

- When you think you’re ready to publish, sign in to the Developer Console and take a few 
  moments for a few final checks.  Make sure that:
  . Your developer profile has the correct information and is linked to the proper Google Wallet 
    merchant account (if you’re selling products).
  . You have the right version of the apps uploaded.
  . All parts of your store listing are ready, including all graphic assets, screenshots, video, 
    localized descriptions, and so on.
  . You have set your app's pricing to free or priced.
  . You have set country (and carrier) targeting and priced your products (if appropriate) in 
    buyer currencies "Compatible devices" shows that your apps are reaching the devices that you’re targeting. 
    If not, you should check with your development team on the apps’ requirements and filtering rules.
  . You’ve provided the correct link to your website and the correct support email address.
  . Your apps don’t violate content policy guidelines.
  . You’ve acknowledged that your apps meets the guidelines for Android content on Google Play 
    and also US export laws.
  . Your apps are now ready to publish!

- If you’re releasing an update, make sure to read the requirements for publishing updates.

- When you’re ready, click the Publish button in the Developer Console. 
  Within a few hours, your apps will become available to users and your product page will appear 
  in Google Play for browsing, searching, or linking from your promotional campaigns.


APPENDIX - SIGING
-----------------

http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html

Signing Your App Manually ...

You do not need Android Studio to sign your app. You can sign your app from the command line 
using standard tools from the Android SDK and the JDK. 

To sign an app in release mode from the command line:

*) Generate a private key using keytool. For example:
     $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
               -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

     This example prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key, and to provide the Distinguished Name 
     fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called my-release-key.keystore. 
     The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. 
     The alias is a name that you will use later when signing your app.

*) Compile your app in release mode to obtain an unsigned APK.

*) Sign your app with your private key using jarsigner:

    $ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1
                -keystore my-release-key.keystore my_application.apk alias_name

     This example prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key. 
     It then modifies the APK in-place to sign it. 
     Note that you can sign an APK multiple times with different keys.

*) Verify that your APK is signed. For example:

    $ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs my_application.apk

*) Align the final APK package using zipalign.

    $ zipalign -v 4 your_project_name-unaligned.apk your_project_name.apk

    zipalign ensures that all uncompressed data starts with a particular byte alignment 
    relative to the start of the file, which reduces the amount of RAM consumed by an app.

Note the ant build system supports the above procedure. All that is needed is to create
the key, using keytool, as in the first step above. And include the key.store and 
key.alias in the ant.properties file.


APPENDIX - GOOGLE PLAY APP DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11071127/google-play-app-description-formatting

- Single line breaks are ignored; double line breaks open a new paragraph.
- Single line breaks can be enforced by ending a line with two spaces (similar to Markdown).
- A limited set of HTML tags (optionally nested), specifically:
    <b>...</b> for boldface,
    <i>...</i> for italics,
    <u>...</u> for underline,
    <br /> to enforce a single line break,
    <blockquote>...</blockquote> to indent a paragraph of text,
    <small>...</small> for a slightly smaller text,
    <sup>...</sup> and <sub>...</sub> for super- and subscripts.
- A fully-formatted URL such as http://google.com; this appears as a hyperlink.
    (Beware that trying to use an HTML <a> tag for a custom description does not work and breaks the formatting.)
- HTML character entities are supported, such as &rarr; (→), &trade; (™) and &reg; (®);
  consult this W3 reference for the exhaustive list.
- UTF-8 encoded characters are supported, such as é, €, £, ‘, ’, ★ and ☆.
- Indentation isn't strictly possible, but using a bullet and em space character
  looks reasonable (&#8226;&#8195; yields "• ").

--- entropy app description follows ---

The purpose of this App is to gain a further understanding of Physics through computer simulations. Includes simulations of:  
- Expanding Gas in a Container  
- Gravity  
- Expanding Universe  
- Random Walk  

Run the Simulations, Observe, and Learn.

Run the Expanding Gas in a Container simulation, and observe:  
- increase in entropy when the gas is released,  
- shrink the container to observe Adiabatic heating,  
- how entropy can occasionally spontaneously decrease.  

Run the Gravity simulation, and observe:  
- orbits of 2 and 3 body systems,  
- impact a rogue star would have on our solar system,  
- solar wobble, used by astronomers to detect extrasolar planets,  
- view planet orbits as seen from the Earth, observe retrograde motion,  
- see how gravity boost works.  

Run the Expanding Universe simulation, and observe:  
- rapid expansion during the early universe,  
- much of the universe lies beyond what can be seen from our vantage point,  
- as the universe ages the size of the observable universe shrinks towards zero.  

Refer to http://wikiscience101.sthaid.org/index.php?title=Entropy_App for additional information.

You are encouraged to download the source code and add your own simulations.  The source code is available at https://github.com/sthaid/proj_entropy.git.  Refer to the README for instructions on how to build this App for Linux or Android.  This App is coded in C, and utilizes the Simple DirectMedia Layer cross-platform development library.  The Random Walk simulation is a good template to use for new simulations. Some suggestions for new simulations are: Elastic Collisions, Nuclear Fission Chain Reaction, and Bacterial Life.
